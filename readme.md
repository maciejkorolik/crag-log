> Web app for rock-climbers that allows to record all climbed routes and provides some visualized statistics about them.

# Introduction

**Crag-log** app was started as a training project to learn React and Redux. I'm a passionate climber so I decided to create an app connected with this sport, that could be helpful for me or other climbers. Current version is quite basic, but it works and has all the functionality that I initially planned. I learned a lot while coding it and had a lot of fun, so I'm planning not to stop at this point and improve it, add more functionality, make it more complex.

### **Demo:**
Live demo of the app is available **[HERE](http://crag-log.herokuapp.com)**

If you just want to check how it works and not create new account, you can just log in with these credentials:
